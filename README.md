# COSI107_Report_Code

## Author: Michelangelo Zampieri 

This repository contains the code associated with my final report for COSI 107: Introduction to Computer Security at Brandeis University, Spring 2025.

This project focuses on adversarial attacks in machine learning. Specifically, the repository includes the code used for the demonstration section of my report.

The demonstration involves creating a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset, followed by attempts to compromise the model using adversarial attack techniques.

Additionally, the project explores the implementation of defense mechanisms to mitigate these attacks, evaluating their effectiveness in improving the model's robustness.

For further details, the accompanying Jupyter notebooks include thorough comments and explanations throughout.
